<h1>What is Password Vault?</h1>
<p>PasswordVault is an Android application through which you can store account information, such as
    passwords, e-mail addresses, pins, addresses and much more. The app allows you to centrally store
    all personal data that you provided to any number of accounts on your Android device locally.</p>
<p>In order to protect your data, the app employs the highest industrial encryption standards, which
    ensures data security and integrity. Furthermore, all data is stored locally on your phone. This
    prevents any sort of device synchronization but ensures that your data cannot be intercepted by
    anyone.</p>
<h1>Add New Accounts</h1>
<p>Once you open PasswordVault, you are presented the home screen. In order to add a new account,
    you need to click the +-button at the bottom right corner of the screen. This will open a new
    screen through which you can configure the account.</p>
