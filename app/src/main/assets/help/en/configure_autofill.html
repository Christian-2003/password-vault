<p>Afterwards, Password Vault is selected as autofill service.</p>

<h2>Prepare Accounts for Autofill</h2>
<p>In order to autofill, Password Vault needs to know which account to use for which of your installed
apps. This can be configured when you edit the respective account.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>edit</b>-button to select an installed app:</p>

<h2>Which Details are Selected</h2>
Usually, you need some sort of username and a password to login to an app. From all provided details,
Password Vault automatically selects a suitable username and password to autofill. However, if you
want to use a specific detail as username or password, you can select the respective option
when editing the detail:

<p>A username selected in this manner is indicated through a small e-mail icon. A password selected
this way is indicated through a small password icon.</p>
<p>If you select multiple details as username or password, the first one will be used for autofill.</p>
