<p>A window opens through which you can restore the backup. If possible, select what to do with
    existing data in case you try to restore data that is already existing.</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Delete all existing data:</b> This deletes all existing data from Password Vault before
        restoring the data from the backup.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Replace duplicates:</b> In case some data is present in Password Vault, it gets replaced
        by the data from the backup.</p></li>

        from the backup is not restored.</p></li>
</ul>
