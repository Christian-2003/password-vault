        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>You can store your most sensitive account information with PasswordVault. Naturally, security is one of our primary concerns.
            Therefore, you might be interested which steps we take to ensure maximum security of your data. We will answer this question
            within this page.</p>
        <h2>Where Is My Data Being Stored?</h2>
        <p>Android provides a unique approach to data storage. Each application has its own directory into which it can store data. The
            operating system prohibits any other app from accessing this directory. Therefore, your data is safe from any other app on your
            device. The internal app storage - in which your sensitive data is stored - can only be accesses through PasswordVault. Furthermore,
            this directory is automatically encrypted by the operating system.</p>
        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>Even though the operating system automatically encrypts the data and prevents any access from outside PasswordVault, this might not
            be enough. Considering the importance of securing your data under any circumstances, PasswordVault additionally encrypts your data
            through the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is one of the most popular encryption algorithms.
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</h3>
        <p>As an industrial standard for over a decade, AES is one of the most secure encryption algorithms that is publicly available. This
            algorithm proved itself to be resilient against any form of attack. After twenty years of existence, no attack has been found that
            can be performed with reasonable time and resources. As an interesting side note, this algorithm is used to encrypt the most
            sensitive and classified documents of the United States Government.</p>
            <p>PasswordVault uses this algorithm to encrypt your data any chance
            it gets with the most secure settings. Those settings include a <b>256 Bit cryptographic key</b>, as well as the <b>GCM mode</b> to
            ensure data integrity. The previously mentioned key is securely stored within the Android Keystore to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Android Keystore</h3>
        <p>The Android Keystore is an integral part of the security environment that is provided by the operating system. It can securely store
            cryptographic keys and prevents their extraction through hardware and software. Generated keys can never be retrieved from the keystore.
            To perform cryptographic operations, the respective data is handed to the keystore, which performs the operations with the stored key.</p>
        <p>PasswordVault uses the Android Keystore to securely store your cryptographic key.</p>
        <h2>Backups</h2>
        <p>You can create backups of your data within the application. These backups are optionally encrypted, if you provide a password. This
            password is used to generate a cryptographic key which is used to encrypt the backup through the AES algorithm. When decrypting your
            data, you need to provide the same password.
