## Description
Password Vault allows you to securely store your most sensitive account data on your device locally. You can add as many accounts to the app as you wish. Each account can contain as many details as you like, such as passwords, e-mail addresses, security questions, etc.

###### Used Technologies
The application is developed with Android Views and Java through the Android Studio IDE. Therefore, the app is built using Gradle.

The app uses Google's Material Design to implement a comfortable and visually pleasing design, that users can intuitively work with.

Furthermore, all data is encrypted through the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Galois / Counter Mode (GCM) with a key size of 256 bits.

###### Miscellaneous
The version numbers for this project are determined based on the guidelines provided by [semver](https://semver.org/).

The project contains a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) which documents all changes that were made to the application in between software versions.

The app implements multiple frameworks that are reused multiple times within the app. An API documentation for these frameworks can be found [here](docs/development/api/README.md).
